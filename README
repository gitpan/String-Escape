::Escape        bdpf  Escape by-name registry and useful functions

This module provides a flexible calling interface to some
frequently-performed string conversion functions, including applying
and expanding standard C/Unix-style backslash escapes like \n and \t, wrapping
and removing double-quotes, and truncating to fit within a desired length.

The escape() function provides for dynamic selection of operations by
using a package hash variable to map escape specification strings to the
functions which implement them. The lookup imposes a bit of a performance
penalty, but allows for some useful late-binding behaviour. Compound
specifications (ex. 'quoted uppercase') are expanded to a list of
functions to be applied in order. Other modules may also register their
functions here for later general use.

This release of String::Escape is intended for public review and
feedback. It has been tested in several environments and no major
problems have been discovered, but it should be considered "beta"
pending that feedback.

To install this package, download and unpack the distribution archive from
http://www.evoscript.com/dist/ or your favorite CPAN mirror, and execute
the standard "perl Makefile.PL", "make test", "make install" sequence.
