String::Escape

This module provides a flexible calling interface to some
frequently-performed string conversion functions, including applying
and expanding standard C/Unix-style backslash escapes like \n and \t, wrapping
and removing double-quotes, and truncating to fit within a desired length.

The escape() function provides for dynamic selection of operations by
using a package hash variable to map escape specification strings to the
functions which implement them. The lookup imposes a bit of a performance
penalty, but allows for some useful late-binding behaviour. Compound
specifications (ex. 'quoted uppercase') are expanded to a list of
functions to be applied in order. Other modules may also register their
functions here for later general use.
